# TPK4170-Group-Assignment

This project was divided into four tasks of which are summarized below. The complete report can be found in the report folder

## Tasks

1. Present the theory of forward kinematics using the Denavit-Hartenberg and the Power-of-Exponentials convention
2. Solve the forward kinematics for the KUKA KR6 R900 sixx (Agilus) robot
3. Solve the inverse kinematics for the KUKA KR6 R900 sixx (Agilus) robot
4. Singularity analysis for the KUKA KR6 R900 sixx (Agilus) robot
